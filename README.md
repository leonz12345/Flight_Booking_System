# Flight Booking System

## About

This is a flight booking service database application with user management and booking capabilities! The services requires user to register and log in, in order for that user to make reservations. One challenge is that the additional commands may be invoked by multiple users concurrently. This is not a problem with read-only command, but it is important in the presence of booking commands that are write commands that may conflict. This application implements transactions that ensure concurrent commands do not conflict.
